## Github Image Hosting

Configuration method is similar to sync configuration.

- Local/Image hosting, use local as image host or use Github repository as image host. Gitee cannot support image hosting functionality.
- jsDelivr acceleration, when enabled, uploaded images will automatically use jsDelivr links.
- Github will create an additional public repository for image hosting (private repositories will not allow normal image access).
