### Enable Image Recognition

When enabled, text recognition will be performed automatically when images are uploaded.

### Primary Recognition Method

Select OCR or VLM as the primary recognition method.

### OCR (Optical Character Recognition)

Uses traditional OCR algorithms to recognize text in images.

#### Language Packs

Select the language packs needed for recognition, supporting multiple languages. Use commas to separate multiple languages, e.g., `chi_sim,eng`.

When adding new language packs, corresponding data files will be downloaded automatically.

#### Using Tesseract

Currently uses [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) as the OCR engine, supporting multiple language packs.

### VLM (Vision Language Model)

Uses AI large models for image understanding and text recognition.

#### Model Selection

Select the AI model for image recognition. Needs to be pre-configured in model configuration.

### Method Comparison

| Feature | OCR | VLM |
|---------|-----|-----|
| Speed | Fast | Slower |
| Accuracy | Higher for standard text | Better for complex scenes |
| Network Requirement | Local execution | Network required |
| Cost | Free | May incur costs |
| Understanding | Text only | Can understand image content |

### Usage Recommendations

- **Pure text extraction**: Use OCR for speed and free usage
- **Complex scenarios**: Use VLM for better recognition of tables, handwriting, complex layouts
- **Batch processing**: Use OCR to save costs and time
- **High accuracy**: Use VLM for more accurate recognition results
