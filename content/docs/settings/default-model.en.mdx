## Configuration

- Primary model, used for AI conversations. When other models are not configured, the primary model will be used.
- Record description, used to process records after OCR recognition and generate record descriptions.
- AI suggestions, AI suggestion prompts for generating placeholder content in AI conversations on the record page.
- Translation, used for content translation scenarios.

Some scenarios don't require powerful models; you can use low-cost models for fast and cost-effective results.
