## What is Prompt?

A Prompt is a system instruction that guides your interactions with the AI assistant, defining the AI's role, behavior, and response style in conversations.

With preset Prompt templates, you can:
- **Save time**: No need to repeatedly enter the same instructions
- **Stay consistent**: Ensure uniform response styles for similar tasks
- **Improve quality**: Well-designed Prompts yield more precise responses

Common use cases include: code review, copywriting, language translation, data analysis, learning assistance, and more.

## Using Prompts

In the Chat interface, you can quickly switch between different Prompt templates via the dropdown menu.

### Switching Prompts

Click the Prompt selector at the top of the chat box and choose your desired template from the list. After switching, the new Prompt is immediately applied to the current conversation and affects all subsequent responses.

### Usage Tips

- **Choose the right Prompt**: Select the template that best matches your current task type
- **Combine flexibly**: You can switch Prompts anytime during a conversation to adapt to different communication needs
- **Reference default templates**: System built-in Prompts are optimized and can serve as references for writing custom Prompts

## Configuring Prompts

### Add Prompt

Click the "Add Prompt" button, enter a title and content to create a custom prompt template.

**Title suggestions**:
- Keep it concise and clear for quick identification (e.g., "Code Review Expert", "English Writing Assistant")
- Avoid being too long, 2-8 characters recommended

**Content suggestions**:
- Define the role: "You are a professional..."
- Specify output format: "Please return in JSON format...", "Please list in a table..."
- Set constraints: "Keep answers concise", "Avoid technical jargon"

### Prompt Optimization

When editing, you can use the AI optimization feature to automatically improve the clarity and effectiveness of your Prompt content.

AI optimization will:
- Add role settings and context
- Optimize instruction expression
- Add output format requirements
- Enhance constraints

After optimization, please verify it meets your expectations and make manual adjustments if necessary.

### Edit Prompt

Click the edit button to modify existing Prompt title and content.

After modifying a Prompt:
- Existing conversations using that Prompt are not affected
- New conversations will use the updated content
- It's recommended to create a backup before making major changes

### Delete Prompt

Click the delete button to remove unwanted Prompts (default Prompts cannot be deleted).

> **Note**: Deletion cannot be undone, so proceed with caution. It's recommended to keep frequently used Prompts. For less used ones, consider disabling rather than deleting.
