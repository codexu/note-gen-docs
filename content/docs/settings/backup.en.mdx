### Local Backup

Manually export application data as a ZIP file, or restore data from a backup file.

#### Export Backup

Click the "Export Backup" button, select a save location, and the application will package all data into a ZIP file. The filename format is `note-gen-backup-YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss.zip`.

#### Import Backup

Click the "Import Backup" button, select the previously exported ZIP file, and the application will restore all data. You need to restart the application for the import to take effect.

### WebDAV Backup

Backup data to cloud servers via WebDAV protocol, enabling cross-device data synchronization.

#### Configuration Items

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Server URL | WebDAV server address, e.g., https://webdav.example.com |
| Username | WebDAV login username |
| Password | WebDAV login password |
| Backup Path | Cloud backup path, e.g., /note-gen/backup |

#### Connection Status

The system automatically detects WebDAV connection status, displayed as:
- **Success**: Connection is normal, backup and sync available
- **Checking**: Verifying connection
- **Failed**: Connection failed, please check configuration

#### Backup Operations

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Backup to WebDAV | Upload local data to WebDAV server |
| Sync from WebDAV | Download data from WebDAV server to local |
| Create Directory | Create new directory if backup path doesn't exist |

#### Use Cases

WebDAV backup is suitable for:
- Using self-hosted cloud storage services (e.g., Nextcloud, ownCloud)
- Enterprise internal file servers
- Cloud storage services supporting WebDAV

#### Notes

- WebDAV backup does not support historical rollback functionality
- Please ensure server address and credentials are configured correctly
- Recommend using HTTPS protocol to ensure data security
