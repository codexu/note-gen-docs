### What are Skills

Skills is an **open standard** introduced by Anthropic—a collection of folders containing instructions, scripts, and resources that AI agents can discover and use to complete tasks more accurately and efficiently.

While AI agents are becoming increasingly capable, they often lack the context needed to reliably perform real work. Skills solve this by providing agents with procedural knowledge and company-, team-, and user-specific context that can be loaded on demand.

Agents with access to a set of Skills can extend their capabilities based on the task they're working on.

#### Benefits for Three Parties

| Role | Benefits |
|-----|----------|
| **Skill Authors** | Build capabilities once and deploy them across multiple agent products |
| **Compatible Agents** | Skills support lets end users give agents new capabilities out of the box |
| **Teams & Enterprises** | Capture organizational knowledge in portable, version-controlled packages |

### Global Skills

Global Skills are available in all workspaces and are suitable for general task scenarios.

### Local Workspace Skills

In addition to Global Skills, you can also create workspace-specific Skills locally:

1. Create a `skills` folder in the root directory of your workspace
2. Create subfolders within the `skills` folder following the Agent Skills specification, where each subfolder represents one Skill
3. Each Skill contains the necessary instructions, scripts, and resource files

The structure of local Skills is identical to Global Skills, but they are only available to the current workspace.

### Managing Skills

#### Import Skill

Click the "Import Skill" button to select a ZIP format Skill package for import.

#### Skill Card

Each Skill displays the following information:
- Skill name and description
- Trigger conditions
- Enable/Disable status

#### Operations

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Enable/Disable | Control whether the Skill is available |
| Edit | Modify Skill configuration |
| Delete | Remove the Skill |

### Skills Capabilities

Agent Skills enable the following capabilities:

| Capability | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Domain Expertise** | Package specialized knowledge into reusable instructions, from legal review processes to data analysis pipelines |
| **New Capabilities** | Give agents new capabilities, such as creating presentations, building MCP servers, analyzing datasets |
| **Repeatable Workflows** | Turn multi-step tasks into consistent and auditable workflows |
| **Interoperability** | Reuse the same skill across different skills-compatible agent products |

### Use Cases

Skills can be used for:
- Automated document processing
- Batch format conversion
- Content analysis and summarization
- Custom workflows
- Periodic task execution
- Legal review processes
- Data analysis pipelines
- Creating presentations
- Building MCP servers

### Open Standard

The Agent Skills format was originally developed by Anthropic, released as an open standard, and has been adopted by a growing number of agent products. The standard is open to contributions from the broader ecosystem.

### Notes

- Imported Skill packages must conform to the specification format
- Disabled Skills will not be invoked by AI
- Confirm you no longer need a Skill before deleting it
