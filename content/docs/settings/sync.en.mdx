### Primary Sync Method

The primary sync method currently supports GitHub, Gitee, GitLab, and Gitea. The reason is that the historical rollback functionality requires Git support (Git does not need to be installed locally).

#### Configuration

##### GitHub/Gitee
- GitHub Access Token, needs to be obtained from [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) or [Gitee](https://gitee.com/profile/personal_access_tokens). Note that repository access permissions are required.
- Auto Sync, when enabled, will perform automatic quick backup after * seconds of stopping input during writing. The commit content is a fixed template and can be collapsed.

##### GitLab/Gitea
- Supports GitLab and Gitea self-hosted instances. Requires configuring server address and access token.
- Also supports historical rollback functionality. All Markdown files will be stored in a private repository.

- Note that you must select GitHub, Gitee, GitLab, or Gitea as the primary backup method for it to take effect. The button is located at the bottom of the page.

### Auto Sync Interval

Set the frequency of automatic data synchronization. When writing, automatic backup will be performed after the set time is reached following input stop.

### Primary Backup Method

Select GitHub, Gitee, GitLab, or Gitea as the primary backup method. Settings take effect only after configuration.

### Notes

- Deleting cloud sync files will also delete files in the remote repository
- Please ensure access tokens are configured correctly and have repository access permissions
- Recommend using private repositories to protect data security
