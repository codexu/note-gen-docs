### Primary Sync Methods

Primary sync methods currently support GitHub, Gitee, GitLab, and Gitea, because the history rollback feature requires Git support (no need to install Git locally).

#### Configuration

##### GitHub/Gitee
- GitHub Access Token, you need to get a token from [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) or [Gitee](https://gitee.com/profile/personal_access_tokens). Note that repository access permissions are required.
- Auto sync, when enabled, automatic quick backup will occur * seconds after stopping input during writing. Commit content uses a fixed template and can be collapsed.

##### GitLab/Gitea
- Supports GitLab and Gitea self-hosted instances, requires configuring server address and access token.
- Also supports history rollback feature, all Markdown files will be stored in private repositories.

- Note that you must select GitHub, Gitee, GitLab, or Gitea as the primary backup method for it to take effect. The button is located at the bottom of the page.

### WebDAV Sync

In addition to Git-based sync methods, NoteGen also supports data synchronization via the WebDAV protocol.

#### Configuration

- **Server URL**: The complete URL address of the WebDAV server
- **Username**: Username for logging into the WebDAV server
- **Password**: Password for logging into the WebDAV server
- **Path**: Optional, specifies the root directory path for synchronization

#### Use Cases

WebDAV sync is suitable for:
- Self-hosted cloud storage services (like Nextcloud, ownCloud)
- Enterprise internal file servers
- WebDAV-supported cloud storage services

#### Important Notes

- WebDAV sync does not support history rollback feature
- Please ensure server address and credentials are configured correctly
- It is recommended to use HTTPS protocol for data security
