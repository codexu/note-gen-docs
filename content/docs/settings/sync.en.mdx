## Primary Sync Methods

Primary sync methods currently support Github and Gitee, because the history rollback feature requires Git support (no need to install Git locally).

### Configuration

- Github Access Token, you need to get a token from [Github](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) or [Gitee](https://gitee.com/profile/personal_access_tokens). Note that repository access permissions are required.
- Auto sync, when enabled, automatic quick backup will occur * seconds after stopping input during writing. Commit content uses a fixed template and can be collapsed.

- Note that you must select Github or Gitee as the primary backup method for it to take effect. The button is located at the bottom of the page.
- All Markdown files will be stored in private repositories.
