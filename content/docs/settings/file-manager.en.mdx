### Current Workspace

Select the default workspace for writing. You can choose any folder for writing.

#### Default Workspace Path

When no custom workspace is set, the application uses the following default paths:

**macOS:**
```
/Users/{username}/Library/Application Support/com.codexu.NoteGen/article
```

**Windows:**
```
C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Local\com.codexu.NoteGen\article
```

**Linux:**
```
/home/{username}/.local/share/com.codexu.NoteGen/article
```

#### Switching Workspace

- Click the workspace input field to open the selection menu
- Select "Select Workspace Directory" to browse and choose a new folder
- Quickly switch to previously used workspaces from history
- Select "Reset to Default Workspace" to restore the application's default path

#### History

The application saves recently used workspace history for quick switching.

- Mouse hover to delete a single history record
- Select "Clear History" to delete all history records

### Resource Path

Set the save path for writing resources, such as images, videos, files, etc.

- Resource files will be saved in the same directory as the currently edited Markdown file
- Can use relative paths or absolute paths
- Leave empty to use the default path `{filename}.assets`

> Tip: Recommend using relative paths for easier project folder movement and sharing.
