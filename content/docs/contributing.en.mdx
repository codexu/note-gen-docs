Hi! Thank you so much for contributing to NoteGen! Before you begin, please take a moment to read the following:

## How to Contribute

Whether you are contributing code or reporting issues, please start by creating an Issue.

### Issues

Always create new issues via [Issues](https://github.com/codexu/note-gen/issues). Please describe the problem in as much detail as possible, including reproduction steps, expected behavior, and actual behavior.

### Discussions

If youâ€™d like to start a discussion, you can use [Discussions](https://github.com/codexu/note-gen/discussions), or join the [community group](https://github.com/codexu/note-gen/discussions/110).

### Pull Request

- Before fixing a bug, please check [Issues](https://github.com/codexu/note-gen/issues) to see if the same issue already exists.
- If you plan to develop a new feature, please first submit an [Issue](https://github.com/codexu/note-gen/issues) to discuss with maintainers whether the feature is needed. This helps save time for both maintainers and contributors.

## Tech Stack

NoteGen mainly uses the following technologies:

- [Tauri 2](https://v2.tauri.app/)
- [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/)
- [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

- See frontend dependencies in [package.json](https://github.com/codexu/note-gen/blob/dev/package.json).
- See Rust dependencies in [src-tauri/Cargo.toml](https://github.com/codexu/note-gen/blob/dev/src-tauri/Cargo.toml).

If your contribution needs to update or add dependencies, please mention the changes to `package.json` or `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` in the issue.

## Development Environment

Please read the [Tauri 2 prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/zh-cn/start/prerequisites/) and configure your environment accordingly.

Once your environment is ready, **fork** the repository to your GitHub account, then clone it locally:

```bash
# 1. Fork to your GitHub account

# 2. Clone locally
git clone https://github.com/your-username/note-gen.git
```

Then enter the project directory and install dependencies:

```bash
# 3. Enter project directory & install dependencies
cd note-gen
pnpm install

# 4. Start local development; if you see a blank screen, try right-clicking to reload.
pnpm tauri dev
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

NoteGen does not use the master or main branches. All development happens on the `dev` branch. Releasing is triggered by merging into the `release` branch, which runs GitHub Actions to build and publish versions.

After forking the repository, create a new branch from `dev` and name it according to your contribution, such as `fix/123` or `feat/121`.

You can push multiple commits until all changes are complete. When submitting a Pull Request, we will use `Squash and Merge` to squash them into a single commit.

Please use `fix(#xxx): ***` or `feat(#xxx): ***` in the PR title, where `#xxx` is the issue number, e.g., [NoteGen Roadmap #46](https://github.com/codexu/note-gen/issues/46).

Before submitting the PR, ensure `pnpm tauri build` can build and run successfully on your local machine.

## Development Guide

This section will guide you through the development of NoteGen.

### DeepWiki

You can quickly learn about NoteGen's development through AI-generated documentation at [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/codexu/note-gen).

### Project Environment Setup

Please read the [Tauri 2 prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) documentation and configure your development environment accordingly.

Start local development with `pnpm tauri dev`. If you encounter a blank screen, try right-clicking and selecting reload.

### Project Building

#### Desktop

Build the desktop application with `pnpm tauri build`. Note that this will create an installation package for your current system.

By default, builds are automated via GitHub Actions, triggered when merging to the `release` branch. This typically involves updating the version number in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`.

#### Android

To build the Android application, first run `pnpm tauri android init`.

Then, follow the [Tauri 2 Android Signing](https://v2.tauri.app/distribute/sign/android/) documentation to create a signing key.

Create a `keystore.properties` file in the `src-tauri/gen/android` directory with the following content:

```properties
storePassword=**
keyPassword=**
keyAlias=**
storeFile=/**/Downloads/upload-keystore.jks
```

Add the following code to `src-tauri/gen/android/app/build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
import java.io.FileInputStream

android {
    signingConfigs {
        create("release") {
            val keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file("keystore.properties")
            val keystoreProperties = Properties()
            if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
                keystoreProperties.load(FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
            }

            keyAlias = keystoreProperties["keyAlias"] as String
            keyPassword = keystoreProperties["keyPassword"] as String
            storeFile = file(keystoreProperties["storeFile"] as String)
            storePassword = keystoreProperties["storePassword"] as String
        }
    }  
}
```

Finally, you can build APKs for different Android architectures using:

```bash
pnpm tauri android build --apk --split-per-abi
```
