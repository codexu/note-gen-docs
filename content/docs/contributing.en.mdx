## How to Contribute

Whether you are contributing code or reporting issues, please start by creating an Issue.

### Issues

### Pull Request

- Before fixing a bug, please check [Issues](https://github.com/codexu/note-gen/issues) to see if the same issue already exists.
- If you plan to develop a new feature, please first submit an [Issue](https://github.com/codexu/note-gen/issues) to discuss with maintainers whether the feature is needed. This helps save time for both maintainers and contributors.

## Tech Stack

NoteGen mainly uses the following technologies:

- [Tauri 2](https://v2.tauri.app/)
- [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/)
- [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

- See frontend dependencies in [package.json](https://github.com/codexu/note-gen/blob/dev/package.json).
- See Rust dependencies in [src-tauri/Cargo.toml](https://github.com/codexu/note-gen/blob/dev/src-tauri/Cargo.toml).

If your contribution needs to update or add dependencies, please mention the changes to `package.json` or `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` in the issue.

## Development Environment

Please read the [Tauri 2 prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/zh-cn/start/prerequisites/) and configure your environment accordingly.

Once your environment is ready, **fork** the repository to your GitHub account, then clone it locally:

```bash
# 1. Fork to your GitHub account

# 2. Clone locally
git clone https://github.com/your-username/note-gen.git
```

Then enter the project directory and install dependencies:

```bash
# 3. Enter project directory & install dependencies
cd note-gen
pnpm install

# 4. Start local development; if you see a blank screen, try right-clicking to reload.
pnpm tauri dev
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

NoteGen does not use the master or main branches. All development happens on the `dev` branch. Releasing is triggered by merging into the `release` branch, which runs GitHub Actions to build and publish versions.

After forking the repository, create a new branch from `dev` and name it according to your contribution, such as `fix/123` or `feat/121`.

You can push multiple commits until all changes are complete. When submitting a Pull Request, we will use `Squash and Merge` to squash them into a single commit.

Please use `fix(#xxx): ***` or `feat(#xxx): ***` in the PR title, where `#xxx` is the issue number, e.g., [NoteGen Roadmap #46](https://github.com/codexu/note-gen/issues/46).

Before submitting the PR, ensure `pnpm tauri build` can build and run successfully on your local machine.
