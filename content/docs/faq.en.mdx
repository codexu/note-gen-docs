## How to solve problems?

NoteGen is still in development, and you may encounter some problems while using it. You can try the following methods to solve them:

- Submit an issue on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/codexu/note-gen/issues) or search for existing issues.
- Join the [community group](https://github.com/codexu/note-gen/discussions/110) to ask other users or developers.

## Common problem solutions

import { Accordion, Accordions } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/accordion';

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="MacOS installation package is damaged, cannot open?">
    NoteGen is not signed, so when installing it, a file is damaged prompt will appear. Different chip solutions are as follows:

    - Intel: Open applications from unknown developers.
    - Silicon: Open the terminal and run the following command:

    ```
    sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/NoteGen.app
    ```

  <Accordion title="Ollama connection failed?">
    Due to Ollama's default parameter configuration, it sets local access when starting, so cross-domain access and port listening need to set the environment variable OLLAMA_ORIGINS.

    ### Use Ollama on macOS

    Use launchctl to set environment variables:

    ```
    launchctl setenv OLLAMA_ORIGINS "*"
    ```

    ### Use Ollama on Windows

    Ollama inherits your user and system environment variables.

    First, click Ollama in the Windows taskbar to exit the program.
    Edit system environment variables from the Control Panel.
    Edit or create the Ollama environment variable `OLLAMA_ORIGINS` for your user account, set the value to * .
    Click OK/Apply to save and restart the system.

    ### Use Ollama on Linux

    If Ollama is running as a systemd service, you should use systemctl to set environment variables:

    ```
    sudo systemctl edit ollama.service
    ```

    For each environment variable, add Environment in the [Service] section:

    ```
    [Service]
    Environment="OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0"
    Environment="OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*"
    ```

    Save and exit.

    ```
    [Service]
    Environment="OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0"
    Environment="OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*"
    ```

    Save and exit.

    ```
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl restart ollama
    ```

  <Accordion title="Why some suppliers' models cannot be used?">
    Due to NoteGen using OpenAI API's browser environment when making AI requests, the supplier's interface must support **cross-domain** access.
    This problem is due to the `http` plugin provided by `Tauri` not being able to implement `stream`, so it cannot provide streaming output, so it cannot support cross-domain requests for the time being.
    > fortunately, most suppliers support cross-domain requests.

  <Accordion title="How to support Gemini?">
    Gemini does not use OpenAI API by default, and needs to use a compatible OpenAI API BaseURL:

    ```
    https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai
    ```
