## From Recording to Writing

NoteGen is divided into `Recording` and `Writing` pages, with the relationship being:

- Recording: manually recorded by tools or generated by AI assistant, can be organized into notes.
- Writing: can insert records or use AI-assisted writing for in-depth composition.

<Callout title="Tip">
  Regular note-taking applications usually don't provide recording functionality. Users need to manually copy and paste for recording, greatly reducing recording efficiency. When facing scattered recorded content, it requires a lot of effort to organize.
</Callout>

### Recording

The recording function is similar to an AI chatbot, but when conversing with it, you can associate already recorded content. Switch the dialogue mode to organization mode to organize records into readable notes.

The following auxiliary functions can help you record better:

- Tags: used to distinguish different recording scenarios.
- Masks: support custom prompts for precise control of your AI assistant.
- Clipboard assistant: can automatically recognize text or images in the clipboard and record them in the list.

### Writing

Writing is divided into two parts: file manager and Markdown editor.
