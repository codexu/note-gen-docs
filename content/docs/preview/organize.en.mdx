## Organization Templates

NoteGen provides simple organization templates, which usually cannot meet requirements. Users need to customize organization templates in `Settings` - `Organization Templates`. Organization templates are similar to prompts, but are only used during organization and allow time range selection (based on record time). For example, you can select within a week to generate weekly reports.

> For configuration instructions, please refer to Configuration - Organization Templates

## Organizing into Articles

After selecting a template, click start organizing. At this point, the article is still output in dialog information in conversational form.

At the bottom of the message, you can see that unlike other conversations, the record button has changed to a writing button. Click it to save this article as a Markdown file and then jump to the writing page for editing.

- Select directory based on your writing folder structure.
- File name is automatically obtained from the AI-generated article title and can be edited. Note that spaces will be converted to `underscores`.
- Whether to delete records - selecting this will delete all records under the current tag.

> Even if you delete current records and tags, you can still insert new records in future writing.
