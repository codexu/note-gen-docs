If you follow the previous chapters, you should now be automatically redirected to the writing page:

<Image width={600} height={400} src="https://s2.loli.net/2025/05/26/ZQHCG65VeY4Knqb.png" alt="Writing page with file manager and editor" />

The left side is the file manager, and the right side is the Markdown editor.

Recording and writing are interconnected but can also be used completely independently.
