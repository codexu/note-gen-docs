## Conversation History

The middle area displays conversation history, including user input, AI responses, clipboard detection information, etc. The left side shows bot information, and the right side shows user input information.

- Conversation history is isolated under different tags.
- AI response content can be recorded as text using the `Record` toolbar below each message.
- Translation: Translate AI conversations to your desired language.
- Clipboard events are triggered when the program gains focus (when switching to the window).
- Clipboard content only exists for 5 seconds and will disappear if not recorded.
- Clicking `X` will delete this conversation and clear the clipboard.
- Some models support `thinking`.
