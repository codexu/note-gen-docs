## Recording Tools

Recording tools provide 5 recording methods: `screenshot`, `image`, `file`, `text`, and `link`. When used appropriately, they can improve recording efficiency for different scenarios.

### Screenshot Recording

<Image width={600} height={400} src="https://s2.loli.net/2025/05/29/QsPSBFw4qIHNgtl.png" alt="Screenshot recording interface with area selection" />

Select an area from a window screenshot, capture the selected area, recognize text through OCR, generate record descriptions via AI (to help users distinguish content), and upload to image hosting.

- Window screenshot order is sorted by the Z-value of the currently active window.
- After selection, double-click the selected area to complete the screenshot.
- Minimized windows cannot be captured.

### Image Recording

When selecting images from local storage or when the AI assistant recognizes clipboard images, image recording can be performed with the same logic as screenshot recording.

- `Screenshot recording` is ultimately recorded as text, **inserting the recognized text into the article**, without inserting the screenshot.
- `Image recording` is ultimately recorded as an image, **inserted into the article as an image**, with position determined by AI through description analysis.

### File Recording

Select files from local storage for file recording. Currently supports `txt`, `md`, `csv`, `pdf` formats, recording them as text.

### Text Recording

Click to open the text recording dialog where users can directly input text, suitable for long text recording or temporary notes.

### Link Recording

Input links to crawl web content. Currently does not support SPA website crawling, ultimately recorded as text.

## Tag Management

Tag management is used to manage record tags, making it convenient for users to categorize records. Tags also affect the AI assistant's conversation records and AI content association.

## Record Content

Record content includes `record type`, `record time`, `record description`, `thumbnail`, and other information.
