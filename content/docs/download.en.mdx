### iOS

NoteGen supports iOS, but due to not having registered a developer account, unsigned applications can only be used for 7 days and are not available on the App Store.

<Callout title="NoteGen Unsigned" type="error">
  If you want to experience on iOS, please compile and install yourself.
</Callout>

## How to Choose Installation Package?

### MacOS

MacOS Intel chip: `x64.dmg`

MacOS Apple M chip: `aarch64.dmg`

NoteGen is currently unsigned, so it will show a corrupted file prompt during installation. Solutions for different chips are as follows:

- Intel: Open Mac applications from unknown developers.
- Silicon: Open Terminal and run the following command: `sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/NoteGen.app`

If you get an error "option -r not recognized", it means your system doesn't support the -r parameter. Please run the following two commands instead:

```
sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/NoteGen.app
sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/NoteGen.app/Contents/MacOS/*
```

### Linux

Linux: `x86_64.rpm`

### Windows

64-bit: `x64-setup.exe`
32-bit: `x86-setup.exe`
